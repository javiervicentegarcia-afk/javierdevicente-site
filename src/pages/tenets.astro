        These are the principles that guide how I practise and advise in cross-border  
        M&amp;A between Italy and Spain.

    <section class="principles">

      <p><strong>Judgment over technique</strong><br />
      Legal technique can be taught; judgment comes from experience and restraint.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Clarity, always</strong><br />
      The role of counsel is to reduce noise, not to author it.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Alignment before execution</strong><br />
      Deals succeed when expectations, incentives and reality are aligned early.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Respectful rigor</strong><br />
      Firm and clear, yet never dismissive—courtesy strengthens position.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Long-term lens</strong><br />
      I approach every deal with the awareness that today’s counterparty could be  
      tomorrow’s partner or client.
      </p>

      <p><strong>People first</strong><br />
      Deals are executed by people, not entities. The human dynamic often  
      determines outcomes.
