      <p>
        These are the tenets that guide how I practise and advise.

        <li>
          ‘Yes’ is the most beauriful answer a client can receive; ‘no’ comes only next.

        <li>
          Legal technique matters, but judgment matters more.
        </li>

        <li>
          Complexity is inevitable in transactions; unnecessary complexity is not.
        </li>

        <li>
          Alignment comes before execution.
        </li>

        <li>
          Firm positions and courtesy are not incompatible.
        </li>

        <li>
          Deals are signed by people, not entities.
        </li>

          “One word of caution that I would like to give is that for trainee solicitors
          it is very common for clients, or superiors, to receive a long-winded essay
          to a question, exploring the jurisprudence, history, development and so on
          of the question asked. The client does not want that.
        </p>
        <p>
          What the client wants is a direct ‘yes’ or ‘no’ in maximum half a page rather
          than an essay ending with ‘not so sure’. Your learning may be impressive or
          dazzling in a college examination, but it is your ability to give an answer
          that we need at the firm.”
