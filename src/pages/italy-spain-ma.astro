      <h1>Italy–Spain M&amp;A</h1>

      <p>
        I advise on cross-border M&amp;A matters involving Italy and Spain.
      </p>

      <!-- SEO “anchor” subtitle (quiet, not brochure-like) -->
      <h2>Italy–Spain cross-border M&amp;A practice</h2>

      <p>
        Much of my work sits in the mid-market, where legal complexity, execution risk and
        commercial judgment tend to overlap most visibly.
      </p>

      <p>
        I regularly advise Italian groups acquiring businesses or assets in Spain, as well as
        Spanish companies entering or expanding into the Italian market. I also act on joint
        ventures and other strategic transactions involving Italian and Spanish parties.
      </p>

      <p>
        Italy–Spain transactions often raise issues that are not immediately apparent at the outset:
        different approaches to risk allocation, governance expectations, formalities and deal timing,
        as well as more subtle negotiation dynamics. These points rarely feature prominently in term
        sheets, yet they tend to shape the outcome of the transaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am typically involved from the structuring phase through to closing and beyond.
        Post-closing reorganisations and day-to-day corporate matters are often where cross-border
        friction resurfaces, and where careful coordination continues to matter.
      </p>

      <!-- SEO “wrap-up” sentence (natural, still partner-tone) -->
      <p>
        My practice covers cross-border M&amp;A transactions between Italy and Spain, acting for buyers,
        sellers and international investors.
