      <h1>Italy–Spain M&amp;A</h1>
      <p>
        I advise corporates, shareholders and investors on cross-border M&amp;A deals
        involving Italy and Spain, acting as a single point of reference across both
        jurisdictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        My practice focuses on mid-market transactions, where legal complexity,
        execution risk and cultural differences tend to converge.
      </p>

      <h2>How I work</h2>
      <p>
        I am involved throughout the full lifecycle of the transaction, from
        structuring and negotiations to closing and post-closing matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being qualified in both Italy and Spain allows me to anticipate cross-border
        issues early and to coordinate efficiently with local and international
        advisors within Pavia e Ansaldo’s platform.

      <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Do you advise on both buy-side and sell-side transactions?</strong><br />
        Yes. I regularly act for both buyers and sellers in Italy–Spain M&amp;A deals.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Do you only work with Italian or Spanish clients?</strong><br />
        No. I also advise international investors involved in transactions with an
        Italian or Spanish component.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>At what stage should a lawyer be involved?</strong><br />
        Ideally from the structuring phase. Early involvement often prevents
        execution and governance issues later in the process.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Do you assist after closing?</strong><br />
        Yes. Post-closing integration and day-to-day corporate matters are a material
        part of my practice.
