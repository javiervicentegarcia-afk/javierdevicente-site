      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Based in Madrid, I practise as an M&amp;A Partner at Pavia e Ansaldo, one of
        the oldest law partnerships in Italy, where I mainly advise on investments
        between Italy and Spain, and <em>vice versa</em>.

        I like to think that my work is guided by a set of professional
        <a href="/tenets/">tenets</a>. In truth, they are rather personal.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also the founder of <strong>Club Agnelli</strong>, a monthly dinner
        bringing together a small group of young business lawyers in Madrid.

      <h2>Matters</h2>
      <p>
        In recent years, I have worked on a range of mid-market deals with Italian
        and Spanish parties across several industries, mostly on the buy-side.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond M&amp;A, I also advise on reorganisations and the day-to-day
        corporate affairs that follow once the deal has closed and the business is
        up and running.

      <h2>Writing</h2>
      <p>
        From time to time, I write about corporate law, as well as other
        more-or-less-unrelated topics.
