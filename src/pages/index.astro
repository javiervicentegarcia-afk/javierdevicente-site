      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I am a Corporate and M&amp;A Partner at Pavia e Ansaldo.</p>

      <p>
        I work mainly on cross-border deals between Italy and Spain.
        This usually involves law, negotiations, and the occasional cultural misunderstanding.
      </p>

      <p>I live in Madrid.</p>
