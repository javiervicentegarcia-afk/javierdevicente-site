      <h2>Practice focus</h2>
      <p>Within Pavia e Ansaldo, my work focuses primarily on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cross-border M&amp;A between Italy and Spain</strong>, mainly in the mid-market,
          across a range of industries, including real estate-related deals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ongoing corporate work</strong>, supporting clients as their business develops
          following the initial transaction.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In recent years, I have worked on a number of significant matters involving Italian and
        Spanish parties, including buy-side and sell-side M&amp;A, joint ventures, mergers,
        restructurings and post-acquisition integration.

      <h2>Writing</h2>
      <p>
        From time to time, I write about legal and practical issues arising from my work on
        cross-border M&amp;A matters, primarily between Italy and Spain, as well as other topics
        that seemed worth writing about.
