      <p>
        I advise on corporate and M&amp;A transactions involving Italy and Spain, acting
        for buyers, sellers and investors across the full transaction process.

      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>
        My practice focuses on corporate and M&amp;A matters, with a particular emphasis on
        cross-border transactions between Italy and Spain.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work with industrial groups, entrepreneurs and investors on acquisitions and disposals,
        joint ventures and corporate reorganisations, assisting throughout the transaction process
        from structuring and negotiations to signing and post-closing matters.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>M&amp;A transactions (buy-side and sell-side)</li>
        <li>Cross-border joint ventures</li>
        <li>Corporate governance and shareholders’ agreements</li>
        <li>Reorganisations and post-acquisition integration</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Italy–Spain focus</h2>
      <p>
        I am qualified in both Italy and Spain and based in Madrid.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work often involves coordinating Italian and Spanish legal workstreams within the same
        transaction, aligning execution across both jurisdictions and managing jurisdiction-specific
        issues as they arise during the deal.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Acquisitions of Spanish operating companies by Italian industrial groups</li>
        <li>Minority and majority investments by Spanish shareholders in Italian businesses</li>
        <li>Cross-border M&amp;A transactions involving multi-jurisdictional teams and advisers</li>
