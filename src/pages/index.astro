      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Based in Madrid, I practise as a M&amp;A Partner within Pavia e Ansaldo’s
        corporate practice, where I mainly advise on cross-border investments and M&amp;A
        between Italy and Spain, and <em>vice versa</em>.

      <h2>Matters</h2>
        <<p>
  In recent years, I have worked on a range of mid-market deals with Italian and
  Spanish parties across several industries, mostly on the buy-side.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond M&amp;A, I also advise on reorganisations and the day-to-day corporate
  affairs that follow once the deal has closed and the business is up and running.

      <h2>Writing</h2>
      <p>
        From time to time, I write about law, cross-border M&amp;A and investments between
        Italy and Spain, as well as other not-so-unrelated topics.
