      <h1>Cross-border Corporate &amp; M&amp;A lawyer – Italy &amp; Spain</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Partner at Pavia e Ansaldo. Madrid-based. Dual-qualified in Spain and Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I advise companies, entrepreneurs and investors on cross-border corporate
        and M&amp;A transactions between Italy and Spain.

      <h2>What I do</h2>
      <p>
        I focus on corporate and M&amp;A matters with a particular emphasis on
        cross-border transactions involving Italy and Spain. I regularly assist
        clients throughout the entire transaction lifecycle, from structuring and
        negotiation to signing and post-closing matters.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>M&amp;A transactions (buy-side and sell-side)</li>
        <li>Cross-border joint ventures</li>
        <li>Corporate governance and shareholders’ agreements</li>
        <li>Reorganisations and post-acquisition integration</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why Italy–Spain</h2>
      <p>
        Having trained and qualified in both Italy and Spain, and being based in
        Madrid, I combine technical legal expertise with a practical understanding
        of the legal, cultural and commercial differences between the two jurisdictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This allows me to anticipate issues that typically arise in Italy–Spain
        transactions and to manage deals efficiently, acting as a single point of
        reference for clients operating across both markets.
